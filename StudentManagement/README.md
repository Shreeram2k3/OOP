## Project Structure

StudentManagement/
- Main.java
- Student.java
- StudentHandler.java

## Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Encapsulation
    - Separation of concerns 
    - Constructor-based dependency passing (`Scanner`)
- Java Collections (`ArrayList`)
- Switch expressions

## How the Application Works

1. The program starts from `Main.java`.
2. A menu is displayed continuously using a loop.
3. The user selects an operation.
4. `StudentHandler` processes the operation.
5. Student data is stored in memory using an `ArrayList`.
